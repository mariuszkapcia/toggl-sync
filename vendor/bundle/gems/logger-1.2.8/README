logger.rb - simple logging utility
  version 1.2.8

CAUTION
  logger is bundled with ruby/1.8 and 1.9 so when you simply do
  'require "logger"' in your lib/app, stock logger.rb is used. You need to
  declare to use the gem version of logger by 'gem "logger"; require "logger"'
  instead.

Document
  See RDoc in lib/logger.rb. To get RDoc in html format, exec 'rake doc'.
